The underlying codes in this directory demonstrates the following experimentation through research and learning :
1. Basic Understanding of Gradient Descent working
2. Gradient Descent's class created by me for 1_Dimensional dataset.
3. Gradient Descent's class created by me for n - Dimensional dataset. (Batch)
4. Stochastic Gradient Descent's class created by me and its implementation.
5. Mini Batch Gradient Descent's class created by me and its implementation.
