In this directory, I have taken few datasets from Kaggle and implemented my learnings & understandings of Feature Selection.
I have segregated it in 3 parts with respect to 3 different feature selection methods as follows:
1. Filter methods :
   1. Removing Duplicate Features
   2. Variance Threshold
   3. Correlation
   4. ANOVA
   5. Chi-Square
   6. Mutual Informtion
      
2. Wrapper Methods :
   1. Exhaustive Feature Selection
   2. Sequential Backward Selection/Elimination
   3. Sequential Forward Selection

3. Embedded Methods :
   1. Recursive Feature Elimination
